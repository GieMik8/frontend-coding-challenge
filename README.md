# Adapt Frontend Coding Challenge

Seems like you're trying out for a position at
[Adapt](https://adapt.dk/en) or you've found this and would like to
apply.  Fork this repo and go at it ;)

Your goal is to provide a functional form in a static HTML file which
asks the user to provide some of their personal information. The form is
a bespoke page with no visual relation to the client's website (you can
use any typefaces, colours, animations and illustrations as you see
fit). The collected data does not have to be stored (for the purposes of
this challenge -- in the real world it would be).

## Brief

As a user of the form I would like to provide necessary data so that I
would have a way of keeping in touch with the company I am interested
in. The form should collect 5 things:

1.  Full name
2.  E-mail address
3.  Date of birth
4.  Up to 5 favourite brands (user can type them in)
5.  Choose any of the four categories: Science, Advertisement, Politics,
    Events

## Requirements

*   You can use any libraries, task runners and build processes you
    like. Bonus points for custom JS (vanilla, ES6 encouraged, but no
    TypeScript, CoffeeScript, etc).

*   Deliverable needs to contain: static HTML file, CSS bundle (with/or
    the original CSS files, bundling is optional), JS bundle (same as
    CSS -- bundling optional, sources needed).

### Criteria

*   Looks and design (aesthetics)
*   UX design (usability, accessibility, user experience)
*   Programming skills
*   _Huge bonus:_ Innovative solution, form that's easy and fun to use
